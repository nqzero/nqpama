PulseAudio Mixer Applet
=======================

Pulseaudio Mixer Applet is a small applet for the GNOME panel that can control
both input and output device volumes, and individual playback stream volumes.
It also provides a convenient way to change the default input and output
devices, and move application audio streams to different devices.



Requirements
------------

This applet can be built with the following:

	libpulse 0.9.15
	gtk+ 2.16
	glib 2.14
	libpanel-applet 2.10
	intltool 0.35.0



Reporting Bugs
--------------

Bugs should be reported on this project's Launchpad page:
	https://launchpad.net/pama


About this Repository
---------------------

this is a branch of the bazaar repository: https://launchpad.net/pama by Vassili Geronimos
the most recent actity recent activity was this update:
  42. By Vassili Geronimos on 2010-04-22, ie almost 8 months ago
goals: make it easier to build and run in a debugger


Changes relative to Parent
--------------------------

removed the use of the pointer/keyboard grabs which made debugging difficult
    ie, caused a deadlock if a breakpoint was set in a callback while the grab was held
added build instructions



Build and Install from Source
-----------------------------

to build:
    libtoolize
    aclocal
    autoheader
    automake --add-missing
    autoconf
    # omit CFLAGS for defaults
    # might also want to pass PKG_CONFIG_PATH, eg to use a debug-enabled gtk+
    CFLAGS="-g -O0" ./configure
    make
    make install

if any of the dependencies are missing, they should cause errors when ./configure is run
    you'll need the development versions of the dependencies, ie the include files
    on debian and ubuntu this means the "-dev" packages
    eg, sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libpanel-applet2-0-dev libpanel-applet2-dev libpulse-dev


note: verbose make output
    not specific to pama, but it uses AM_SILENT_RULES, which results in make being very quite by default
    ie, instead of printing the full gcc command line, it only prints a summary
        eg,   CC     pulseaudio_mixer_applet-pama-pulse-context.o
    to get the verbose output, use "make V=1"



Netbeans
--------

it was easy to import this project into pama:
    create a new C project from existing sources
    choose the automatic configuration

the netbeans-ified version of the project is checked in as branch: netbeans
