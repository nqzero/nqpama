Netbeans
--------

it was easy to import this project into netbeans
    create a new C project from existing sources
    choose the automatic configuration

the netbeans-ified version of the project is checked in as branch: netbeans
    netbeans changes some of the IDE files in non-portable and unnecessary ways
    as a result, i'm working on master and only plan on updating the netbeans branch with IDE specific changes

to add the IDE specific files (so that it can be opened as a netbeans project)
    git checkout remotes/origin/netbeans -- nbproject Makefile-pama.mk

switching to the netbeans branch is more complicated ...
    the nb-specific files are gitignored in master, so need to manually move them
    probably the best thing to do is "mkdir bak; mv nbproject Makefile-pama.mk bak"
    git checkout netbeans
    and then manually merge the changes from bak
    this should only be done when there's an IDE specific change that you want to 'save'
