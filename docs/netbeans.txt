Netbeans
--------

it was easy to import this project into netbeans
    follow the build instruction in README
    create a new C project from existing sources
    choose the automatic configuration
    this uses the C/C++ plugin, tested with version 1.9.3
    netbeans will rerun ./configure


the netbeans-ified version of the project is checked in as branch: netbeans
    netbeans changes some of the IDE files in non-portable and unnecessary ways
    as a result, i'm working on master and only plan on updating the netbeans branch with IDE specific changes

to add the IDE specific files (so that it can be opened as a netbeans project)
    git checkout remotes/origin/netbeans -- nbproject Makefile-pama.mk
    git reset                    # the checkout adds the "new" files ... undo the add


switching to the netbeans branch is more complicated ...
    the nb-specific files are gitignored in master, so need to manually move them
    probably the best thing to do is "mkdir bak; mv nbproject Makefile-pama.mk bak"
    git checkout netbeans
    and then manually merge the changes from bak
    this should only be done when there's an IDE specific change that you want to 'save'



to open an existing netbeans project
    run the build instructions thru at least ./configure
    add the nb-specific files (see above)
    open the project
